### PRACTICAL GUIDANCE

**Labor & Employment**

A new step-by-step module – [Respond to Workplace
Emergencies](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/labor/le_home/secondary_page/inpractice_le52 "Respond to Workplace Emergencies")
– is available on the [Labor & Employment Practice
Center](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/labor/page/le_home "Labor & Employment Practice Center")
and via the [Practical Guidance
homepage](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/page/pg_home "Practical Guidance homepage").
The module provides links to overviews, checklists, and sample policies
on best practices and workplace policies, as well as information on
related legal obligations and considerations.

**Corporate**

Legal Operations Practical Guidance offerings have been expanded with a
new set of documents focused on [Resource & Vendor
Management](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/corporate/page/cp_pg_resource_vendor_mgmt "Resource & Vendor Management").
Authored by senior in-house counsel at 7-Eleven, new materials include
sample forms, retention agreements, checklists, and overviews. They are
designed to help legal operations professionals improve the efficiency
and effectiveness of the legal department and the business as a whole.
The new page can be found via the [Practical Guidance
homepage](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/page/pg_home "Practical Guidance homepage")
or on the [Legal Department Practice
Page](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/corporate/page/cp_legaldept "Legal Department Practice Page")
within the Corporate Practice Center.

**Benefits & Executive Compensation**

New step-by-step Practical Guidance – [Implement a Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation
Plan](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/bec/bec_home/page/inpractice_bec18 "Implement a Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan")
– is available on the [Benefits & Executive Compensation Practice
Center](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/bec/page/bec_home "Benefits & Executive Compensation Practice Center")

A nonqualified deferred compensation plan is any plan or arrangement,
including a plan or arrangement covering only one person, in which a
portion of an individual's current compensation will be payable in a
later taxable year. A typical executive pay package includes the use of
nonqualified deferred compensation plans that are structured to defer
the timing of taxation on compensation. Strict compliance with tax code
requirements and the constructive receipt and economic benefit doctrines
are necessary to avoid current taxation and penalties. New Practical
Guidance content includes overviews, forms, sample policies, timeline,
and checklist.

### IN FOCUS PAGES

\
**In Focus: Right to Try**

\
**In Focus: Opioid Issues for Health Care Providers**

There are two new In Focus pages on the Health Care Practice Center:
[Right to
Try](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/health/health_home/page/infocus_right_to_try "Right to Try")
and [Opioid Issues for Health Care
Providers](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/health/health_home/page/infocus_opioid_issues "Opioid Issues for Health Care Providers").

**Right to Try**: Since 2014, when Colorado passed the first bill
allowing terminally ill patients to use experimental drugs not yet
approved by the Food and Drug Administration, 40 states have passed
their own “Right to Try” bills. Following the states' lead, Congress
passed the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew
Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017. This In Focus page is designed to help
health law attorneys navigate both federal and state legislation, track
changes as they arise, and find additional guidance.

**Opioid Issues for Health Care Providers**: The ongoing crisis of
opioid abuse in the United States has focused attention on the
manufacturers and distributors of opioids, but many state and federal
authorities are also looking to health care providers in an effort to
curb the abuse. This In Focus page tracks state laws and regulations
governing prescribing and dispensing opioids, and provides news,
analysis, and updates on litigation.

**In Focus: Deal Points**

Bloomberg Law has just completed publication of a 21-part series,
“Trends in M&A Provisions,” which examines trends in private company
M&A deal points. Available on the In Focus: Deal Points page, the
studies – co-authored by Dan Avery, Director at Goulston & Storrs PC,
and several colleagues – provide deal lawyers with practical insights
into how the M&A market is dealing with the most significant and
nuanced drafting and negotiating issues. They also offer valuable
insights into what’s market for private transactions attorneys.

### STATE CHART BUILDERS

A new 50-state chart builder, [Investment Adviser Firm Registration &
Reporting](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blaw/bbna/chart/75/10064 "Investment Adviser Firm Registration & Reporting"),
is now available on the Securities Practice Center. The chart covers
registration requirements for state-registered investment adviser firms,
including applications and renewal requirements, bonding rules,
record-keeping requirements, and termination provisions. The chart is
available on the [Securities Practice
Center](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/securities/page/se_home "Securities Practice Center")
homepage from the Chart Builders & Quick Reference Guides drop-down and
on the [Chart Builders
homepage](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/page/chart_builders_home "Chart Builders homepage").

A new Corporate Chart Builder – [Business Entity Conversion and
Domestication](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/corporate/bbna/chart/75/10045 "Business Entity Conversion and Domestication")
– compares the statutory provisions of each state and the District of
Columbia relating to the conversion of a business entity from one form
(such as a stock corporation) to another (for example, a limited
liability company). In a conversion, all rights, liabilities, and assets
of the converting entity (the stock corporation, in this example)
transfer by operation of law to the converted entity (the limited
liability company). Conversion is a one-step process by a single
organization. It is simpler than a merger because only one set of owners
needs to authorize the transaction and there is no change of control.
The chart is available on the [Chart Builders
homepage](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/page/chart_builders_home "Chart Builders homepage")
and the [Corporate Practice
Center](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/corporate/page/cp_home "Corporate Practice Center")
homepage from the Chart Builders and State Surveys drop-down.

Guidance collection, including checklists on:

* [Drafting a Drug-Free Workplace
  Policy](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blaw/document/XFP5A7UG000000 "Drafting a Drug-Free Workplace Policy")
* [Defending Title VII Sex Discrimination and Sexual Harassment
  Litigation](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blaw/document/X743STK4000000 "Defending Title VII Sex Discrimination and Sexual Harassment Litigation")
* [Drafting a Response to an Employee Demand
  Letter](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blaw/document/XFJUH3FS000000 "Drafting a Response to an Employee Demand Letter")
* [Negotiating Class Action Waivers for Employment Arbitration
  Agreements](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/labor/document/XD9R1T2K000000 "Negotiating Class Action Waivers for Employment Arbitration Agreements")
* [Defending FMLA Claims: Part
  1](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blaw/document/X43Q6JGS000000 "Defending FMLA Claims: Part 1")
* [Defending FMLA Claims: Part
  2](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blaw/document/X9C5CF2O000000 "Defending FMLA Claims: Part 2")
* [Pointers on Handling FMLA
  Requests](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blaw/document/XB690UN4000000 "Pointers on Handling FMLA Requests")
* [Guidelines for Employer Handbook Rules
  Post-Boeing](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/labor/document/X1GGFUJG000000 "Guidelines for Employer Handbook Rules Post-Boeing")

New modules have been added to the L&E Practical Guidance Library:
[Step-by-Step: Understand the Interplay Between the FMLA &
ADA](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/labor/le_home/secondary_page/inpractice_le117 "Step-by-Step: Understand the Interplay Between the FMLA & ADA")
provides guidance in situations in which an employee’s medical leave
request may impose obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act
and the Family and Medical Leave Act; [Step-by-Step: Create Gender
Identity Policies and Transition
Plans](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/labor/le_home/secondary_page/inpractice_le116 "Step-by-Step: Create Gender Identity Policies and Transition Plans")
explains how employers may need to accommodate transgender and
transitioning employees in the workplace; and [Step-by-Step: Manage
Employees' Marijuana
Use](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/page/inpractice_le119 "Step-by-Step: Manage Employees' Marijuana Use")
provides compliance guidance and best practices information for
employers confronting marijuana-related issues in the workplace.
Companies operating in states that have legalized medical and/or
recreational marijuana use or that prohibit job bias against lawful
medical pot users may require clarification about the effect of such
laws on their organizations against the backdrop of federal law banning
marijuana use and possession.

**Patents & Trade Secrets**  

Two new suites of Practical Guidance – [Protecting Trade
Secrets](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/ip/pts_home/page/pts_pg_protecting_tradesecrets "Protecting Trade Secrets")
and [Trade Secret
Remedies](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/ip/pts_home/page/pts_pg_tradesecrets_remedies "Trade Secret Remedies")
– are now available on the Patents & Trade Secrets home page and on the
Trade Secrets practice page.  Trade secrets are a unique and
increasingly important form of intellectual property.  Because their
value to a business – as protectors of product value, collateral for
capital formation, and source of licensing revenue – depends on
efficient management and use of holder-controlled information, employers
seeking to protect trade secrets must take a number of precautions to
ensure that their sensitive information remains secret. These two new
Practical Guidance suites provide the overview, insight, checklists,
tables, and forms that practitioners need to help them navigate the
complex network of federal and state law that governs the use and
defense of these critical assets.

**Corporate**  

Thirty-eight new Practical Guidance documents have been added to our
Compliance suite across anti-corruption programs, management of third
parties, and reputational risk. The new documents include two new
assessment tools, as well as more than a dozen checklists, several
sample forms, and three full-color roadmaps. The total number of
documents in the Compliance Practical Guidance collection now numbers
more than 300.  The new documents are available on the following
Compliance topic pages: [Ethics &
Corruption](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/corporate/cp_compliance/page/cp_inpractice_corruption "Ethics & Corruption");
[Preventing
Noncompliance](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/corporate/page/cp_inpractice_prevention "Preventing Noncompliance");
and [Building the
Program](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/corporate/cp_compliance/page/cp_inpractice_program "Building the Program").

**Tech & Telecom**

**Banking & Finance**  

A new step-by-step Practical Guidance page on [Initial Coin Offerings
(ICOs)](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/page/stepxstep_ico "Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)")
has been added to our Capital Markets suite and to our ICO In Focus
Page. Practical Guidance covers the steps required to determine the need
for an ICO and to ultimately complete the ICO process. The new ICO page
includes overviews of structural, transactional, regulatory, and legal
issues. It also includes checklists, timelines, comparison tables,
forms, and trackers for legal practitioners and market participants who
are interested in initial coin offerings, security token offerings
(STOs), cryptocurrency, and developments in securities law and FinTech. 
The page is also included in the Practical Guidance boxes on [Tech &
Telecom](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/tech/page/tt_home "Tech & Telecom")
and [Banking &
Finance](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/bankfinance/page/bf_home "Banking & Finance").

### CHART BUILDERS

A new 50-state Chart Builder covering [Limited Partnership
Dissolution](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blaw/bbna/chart/75/10048 "Limited Partnership Dissolution")

different types of dissolution, resolution of claims, distribution of

Practice Center home page, the [Alternative Entities Practice
Page](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/corporate/page/cp_altentities "Alternative Entities Practice Page"),

is now available on the [Securities Practice
Center](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/securities/page/se_home "Securities Practice Center")
and the new [Chart Builders
homepage](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/page/chart_builders_home "Chart Builders homepage")
under Blue Sky/Securities.  Most states charge fees related to
securities transactions that occur within the state. These fees include
those charged for the registration and offering of securities, and for
the registration and licensing of broker-dealers, investment advisers,
and other market participants. This Chart Builder allows users to
identify particular fees charged by states and to compare all state
securities fees across various jurisdictions.

### LITIGATION ANALYTICS

Recent enhancements to [Litigation
Analytics](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blaw/litigation/analytics/new "Litigation Analytics")
include:  

* Updated user interface for Company and Law Firm Analytics, matching
  the style and functionality of Judge Analytics.  
* Improved print/download/email (PDE) functionality and custom
  downloading.  Users can now narrow their selection of information
  for downloading.  For example, if a user is only interested in
  generating a report of the representation information for a company,
  the user can select “Law Firms” from the Company Analytics PDE
  screen and limit the download to that information.  In addition,
  users will have the flexibility to select either the analytic
  charts, the list of cases, or both, thus allowing them to tailor the
  report to meet their specific needs.  
* Enhanced scope of coverage:  
  * Company Analytics includes all of a company’s federal litigation
    dating to 2007; it is not limited to cases where the company is
    represented by one of the 7000 law firms in the Bloomberg Law
    database.  
  * Law Firm Analytics includes all of a law firm’s federal
    litigation dating back to 2007, including cases where the firm
    represents an individual or a private company.  It is not
    limited to cases where that law firm represented one of the
    70,000 public or 3.5 million private companies in the Bloomberg
    company database.

### PRACTICAL GUIDANCE

**Labor & Employment**

The Labor & Employment Practice Center has added 53 sample federal

indispensable resources for in-house and law firm practitioners.

– providing insight into industry and standards, and addressing what
inventors, practitioners, and business people need to know to use
standards to their advantage.  Technical standards, particularly for
information and communications technology (ICT) industries, require use

In Focus: Challenge to Post-Grant Proceedings at the Supreme Court (Oil
States Energy Svcs, LLC v. Greene's Energy Group, LLC, U.S., No. 16-712,

has been added to the Patents & Trade Secrets Practice Center.  At issue
in Oil States is whether the inter partes review procedure established
by the America Invents Act violates the U.S. Constitution by allowing
private property rights to be terminated through a non-Article III forum
without a jury. Oil States Energy LLC contends that only a court can
extinguish patent rights.  The [In
Focus](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/ip/pts_home/page/pts_infocus_oil_states "In Focus")
practice page is available on both the Patents & Trade Secrets home page
and the Post-Grant practice page.  Of great interest to law firms and

Patent challenges, the In Focus practice page includes in-depth
background, news, and analysis of the topic.

Chart](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/labor/le_home/document/5318959144 "State/Local Salary History Provisions Chart")

### SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY

Bloomberg Law has introduced enhancements to secondary content
searching, including:

  suggestion for: American Law Institute (ALI) - Restatement (Second)
  of Contracts.  
* Updated [Reference
  Materials ](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/start#advanced-search/edit/books)search:
  providing for a search across all books content (manuals,
  portfolios, books & treatises).  An additional enhancement allows
  users to search across the full text of content, as well as over
  book and, or chapter titles  
* Exposure of the source tree in the search form: allowing users to
  browse through the entire reference collection.

The enhanced Reference Materials search is a significant improvement,
allowing users to search over all Bloomberg Law book content (books &
treatises, portfolios, and manuals) in one search.  Previously, each
content type had to be searched separately.  Search by book or chapter
title provides additional search options.  Exposing the source tree in
the search form provides context, and insight into content
organization.
