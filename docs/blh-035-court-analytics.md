## Notes
-	Motion Outcomes and Appeal Outcomes analytics are based on Bloomberg Law’s Court Opinion and BCITE information. Topic information is generated from the topics tagged to a Federal Court’s opinions.
-	Length of Case and Appearances & Case Types analytics are based on U.S. District Court dockets from 2007-forward, excluding criminal dockets and prisoner petitions. Case type information is generated from the Nature of Suit codes assigned to the individual dockets.
