**DASHBOARDS**

**Dashboards** can be created from scratch or by starting with one of our pre-made **Template** dashboards.

Currently available search-based tile types include News, Dockets, Court Opinions, EDGAR, Transactional Precedents, People, Patents, All Legal, Law Reports Company Screener, and Notes.

Alternatively, you also have quick access to your dashboards through a **My Dashboards** link on the **Browse All Content Menu:**

![BIC My Dash Home](/images/bic-my-dash1.png)

![BIC My Dash 2](/images/bic-my-dash2.png)

Select "Create Dashboard" to launch our Dashboard Wizard

![BIC Create 1](/images/bic-create1.png)

**Step 1:** Select Dashboard Type. Each has unique content options

![BIC DB Create Lead](/images/bic-db-create-lead.png)

![BIC DB Create Temp](/images/bic-db-create-temp.png)

**Step 2:** Customize Dashboard Content. For example, if you selected "Follow a Company"

![BIC DB Create 1](/images/bic-db-create-1.png)

![BIC DB Create 2](/images/bic-db-create-2.png)

![BIC DB Create 3](/images/bic-db-create-3.png)

Your Custom Dashboard:

![BIC DB Custom](/images/bic-db-custom.png)

Edit searches using the search criteria accessible directly from the tile or, modify additional search criteria by clicking on **View More** from the front of the tile:

![BIC DB View More](/images/bic-view-more.png)

And then selecting “Edit Search” to access all search criteria:

![BIC Edit Search 2](/images/bic-edit-search2.png)

Once you run a new search, you can create a tile directly from the search results page:

![BIC Add Search 2](/images/bic-add-search2.png)

Create tiles for your **Dashboard** from any saved searches previously created on _Bloomberg Law_:

![BIC View All](/images/bic-view-all.png)

![BIC Add Saved Search](/images/bic-add-saved-search.png)

Add notes to your **Dashboards** using a **Notes** tile.

![BIC 15 New](/images/bic-15-new.png)

You can name, move and resize (small, medium and large) the tiles on a **Dashboard**. You can set alerts from any of your tiles:

![BIC Set Alert](/images/bic-set-alert.png)

Name the **Dashboards** and share them by email with any _Bloomberg Law_ user at your organization:

![BIC EMail DB 1 A](/images/bic-email-db1a.png)

![BIC EMail DB](/images/bic-email-db.png)

Shared **Dashboards** are edited only by the sender, not by the recipient(s). Any changes the sender makes to the **Dashboard** is viewable by a recipient the next time the recipient accesses or refreshes the **Dashboard** link.

**Dashboards** are refreshed automatically, so the most up-to-date results display first.

You can set the **Business Intelligence Center** or any one of your **Dashboards** as your homepage:
