### BRIEF ANALYZER

Bloomberg Law&#39;s highly-anticipated Brief Analyzer was released February 10th to all Bloomberg Law complete subscribers. This AI-powered tool automates steps in traditional legal brief analysis, expediting the review and evaluation of cited authorities and suggesting additional resources for review.

The new litigation tool is easy to use. Simply upload or drag and drop a brief as indicated on the [Brief Analyzer](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blaw/analyses/briefs/new) landing page. In seconds, Brief Analyzer will:  
  - Display the brief and analysis in a side-by-side comparison
  - Suggest relevant content not cited in the brief, providing detailed reasons for the suggestions
  - Enhance your research by integrating practice tools such as BCiteSM, Points of Law, and Docket Key® into the brief analysis
  - Link to additional resources on our platform including similar briefs and Practical Guidance

Brief Analyzer is available from [Popular Links](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/start) on the Bloomberg Law homepage and via the [Litigation Intelligence Center](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blic/page/blic_home).
