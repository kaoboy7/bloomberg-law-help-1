## Recent Updates

### PRACTICAL GUIDANCE

A new [Return to Work Practical Guidance](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/labor/le_home/page/le_pg_emergencies_violence) suite includes 12 new documents responding to companies&#39; stated needs to understand the complicated and intertwined issues related to bringing office-based employees back to the workplace following work-from-home orders during the pandemic. The Practical Guidance is intended to help companies design and implement policies and procedures for the return of employees to the office. Available in the [Coronavirus Toolkit](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/health/page/pg_coronavirus) in the Return to Work tile and in the [Labor &amp; Employment Practical Guidance Library](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/labor/le_home/page/le_pg_emergencies_violence).

Two new pages covering [Contract Actions](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blic/page/blic_pg_contract_actions) and [Contract Defenses](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blic/page/blic_pg_defenses_contract) have been added to Bloomberg Law&#39;s offering of Litigation Practical Guidance. This new coverage explains different contract-based causes of action, addressing the demand for state-specific precedent through Points of Law citations and curated court opinion searches. This content will be helpful to both junior associates new to the practice of law and to more senior associates who may be pivoting in the economic downturn towards more general commercial litigation matters that focus on contract disputes.

### TRACKERS

Many states have launched contact tracing efforts to mitigate the effects of Covid-19. These programs are now tracked on the [Privacy &amp; Data Security Practice Center](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/privacy/page/pds_home) in our U.S. State Privacy Profiles within the Emerging Issues and Outlook section. The profiles include laws passed, apps launched or in development, and the type of technology used, as well as details about how the personal information is collected and used.

### IN FOCUS

#### In Focus: Remaining Operational

As a result of the recent economic downturn, more and more businesses have been forced to consider whether to continue in operation or to dissolve their organization. To help in-house counsel and outside advisers provide well-informed advice on this issue, [In Focus: Remaining Operational](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/BLCP/page/cp_infocus_remaining_operational)features a wealth of information on matters that a business must consider in order to continue operations, including content related to contracts, corporate governance, transactions, and employment issues. This page will help counsel make strategic decisions about their companies and provide them with the legal tools to execute those decisions.

Featuring new Practical Guidance documents, this page pulls content from various practice areas and provides practitioners with a complete package of resources to consider when making a decision to close a business.

#### In Focus: Lawyer Well-Being

After two 2016 studies set off alarm bells on the mental health of the legal profession, a small group of lawyers formed a national task force and started a movement to improve the health and well-being of legal professionals. Reflecting Bloomberg Law&#39;s support of this goal, the [In Focus: Lawyer Well-Being](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/BLIC/page/infocus_wellbeing) page promotes a variety of resources in support of a good workplace environment, including:

### BLOOMBERG LAW ANALYSIS

[Analysis: Feds Seize PPE Using Unlitigated Hoarding Statute](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-feds-seize-ppe-using-unlitigated-hoarding-statute)

Although price gouging is not covered explicitly by federal statute, the U.S. government has begun seizing medical supplies under the anti-hoarding provision of the Defense Production Act. That statute, however, is virtually unlitigated. For businesses that need to source scarce materials, there is little guidance that legal counsel can provide about permissible behaviors.
