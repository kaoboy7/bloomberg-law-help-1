### PRACTICAL GUIDANCE

Bloomberg Law's [Litigation Practical
Guidance](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blic/page/blic_pg_library "Litigation Practical Guidance")
includes overviews, checklists, and sample forms and filings that walk
users through the legal and logistical issues related to initiating and
defending litigation. Bloomberg Law's unique integration of content,
functionality, and tools such as Points of Law, Smart Code, and Docket
Key -- combined with the guidance of litigation experts -- walks users
quickly through the stages of pretrial practice and anticipates
procedural next steps. Litigation Practical Guidance is available on the

Center](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blic/page/blic_pg_library "Litigation Intelligence Center")

Contents** allowing for easy navigation throughout a document; links to
**Related Content** in the right rail of each Practical Guidance page;

### IN FOCUS RESOURCES  

**In Focus: Legal Operations**

New [In Focus: Legal
Operations](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/corporate/cp_home/page/cp_infocus_legalops "In Focus: Legal Operations")
provides news, analysis, and practical guidance on legal operations, a
multidisciplinary approach to managing a corporate legal office or law
firm that aims to improve the organization\'s efficiency, productivity,
and profitability. One of the principal means of achieving those ends is
the adoption of technological solutions to reduce professional time
loss. The new page includes a new, proprietary survey on the state of
legal operations and legal technology.

The new In Focus page is available on the [Corporate Practice
Center](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/corporate/page/cp_home "Corporate Practice Center")
as well as the [In Focus
Resources](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/page/infocus_home "In Focus Resources")
homepage.

**In Focus: Mobile Health Technology**

Mobile health technology innovation is developing at a rapid pace, with
a wide variety of actual and potential functions offering benefits to
patients and health care providers. These technologies also come with
risks to public health, so federal agencies such as the FTC, FDA, and
HHS OCR provide oversight of them through various regulatory authority.
Precisely what regulatory schemes a particular mobile health app is
subject to is a complicated determination. The new [In Focus: Mobile
Health
Technology](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/health/health_home/page/infocus_mobile_health_technology "In Focus: Mobile Health Technology")
page offers resources to help those advising app developers, and those
who use such apps in providing care to patients, to determine what
regulations they need to follow and what compliance issues they should
consider on an ongoing basis.

The new In Focus page is available on the [Health Practice
Center](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/health/page/health_home "Health Practice Center"),

Technology](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/health/page/health_healthit "Health Information & Technology")

Sciences](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/health/page/health_pharma_life_sciences "Pharmaceuticals & Life Sciences")
page, and [In Focus

homepage.

**In Focus: Right-to-Work**

Now that a majority of U.S. states have right-to-work laws (laws that
forbid requiring nonunion employees to join a union or to pay union dues
as a requirement of employment), scrutiny of such laws is on the rise.
The new [In Focus: Right-to-Work
Laws](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/labor/le_home/page/infocus_right_to_work_laws "In Focus: Right-to-Work Laws")
provides news, analysis, recent court opinions, and additional coverage
including opposing professional perspectives by Irwin H. Cutler, Jr.
(Union Challenges Under Right to Work Law) and David L. Barron (Right to
Work Laws: It's All About Free Markets and Employee Choice).

The new In Focus page is available on the [Labor & Employment Practice
Center](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/labor/page/le_home "Labor & Employment Practice Center")
and the [In Focus
Resources](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/page/infocus_home "In Focus Resources")
homepage.

### IN FOCUS  

**Banking**

[In Focus: Fannie-Freddie
Conservatorship](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/bankfinance/bf_home/page/bf_infocus_fanniefreddie "In Focus: Fannie-Freddie Conservatorship")
covers the legal issues surrounding the Federal Housing Finance Agency's
(FHFA) ongoing conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In the
aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008, Fannie and Freddie --
government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) with private investors --
required a bailout from the U.S. Treasury. The newly-created FHFA was
appointed as conservator of the two GSEs, and a deal was reached with
the Treasury in which all profits and net worth would be given back to
the Treasury rather than to Fannie and Freddie's investors. This In
Focus page compiles agency materials regarding the conservatorship,
examines a recent Trump administration plan to end the conservatorship,
and discusses litigation involving Fannie and Freddie's aggrieved
investors. The page can be found on the [Banking & Finance Practice
Center](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/bankfinance/page/bf_home "Banking & Finance Practice Center"),

FinTech](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/bankfinance/bf_home/page/bf_infocus_criminal_fintech "In Focus: Legislation on Criminal Use of FinTech")
focuses on two bills that recently passed in the House of
Representatives with bipartisan support. Both bills direct government
agencies to take a closer look at how financial technology, such as
virtual currency, is being used in the commission of crimes such as
human trafficking or terrorism. The page provides summaries for each
bill, as well as related bills from the previous congress, and important
links. The new In Focus page can be found on the [Banking and Finance
Practice

insurance companies, and other entities regulated by the New York
Department of Financial Services. These first-in-the-nation regulations
require regulated entities to meet certain cybersecurity standards, to
designate a Chief Information Security Officer, and to have plans in
place to deal with data breaches and other incidents. Regulated entities
must certify compliance with the regulations by February 15, 2019. The
page provides relevant forms, important links, and also highlights the
Privacy & Data Security Practice Center's Practical Guidance on this

focuses on the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) new
accounting standard that will require banks to record their expected
losses over the lifetime of a loan, or the current expected credit
losses (CECL), upfront. Most entities will be expected to have adopted
the rule by January 2020. The page tracks the development of the rule,
as well as the current debates surrounding its implementation and how it
may reduce retained earnings for banks. The new In Focus page can be
found on the [Banking and Finance Practice

### IN FOCUS

**In Focus: California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**

privacy rights and establishes a private right of action for security
breaches and potential statutory damages.  Businesses subject to the
CCPA must comply by Jan. 1, 2020. However, the text of the law contains
a 12-month look-back provision, which requires businesses to respond to
consumer requests for personal information collected or sold within the
past 12 months.
