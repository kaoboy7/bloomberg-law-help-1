## Dockets Overview

_Bloomberg Law_ gives you the freedom to be proactive with unrestricted, unlimited dockets searches and alerts, making it easy and cost effective to include dockets in your regular research process. 

Monitor new actions, identify business opportunities, conduct due diligence or just expand your legal research in federal, state and international courts.

## Docket Key®

**Bloomberg Law's®** proprietary **Docket Key®** docket filing classification system is a unique and innovative system that identifies and classifies entries on a
docket sheet. 

**Docket Key** makes locating underlying filings easy, quick, and
precise by targeting 20 categories, including motions, briefs, orders,
and more!


This technology guarantees access to the filings you are looking for
instead of those that mention the keyword.

Docket Key is available for civil cases in all federal district courts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Advanced Search Functionality

The Filing Type filter targets your search to specific filing types and docket entries for civil cases only

![DK1](/images/docket-key-1.png "DK1")

Use the Apply Date To toggle to search either by the date the docket was
opened or the date the entry was filed.
