**How to Use the EDGAR Filing Type Fields**

1. **KEYWORDS -**  Search for exact phrases by placing them in quotes, or connect keywords using Boolean search operators.  **Keywords** **can apply to: (1)**  **Forms Only**  if you want your search terms to appear only in the SEC Form (e.g., in the 10-Q, but not in any exhibits); (2) **Exhibits Only**  if you want your search terms to appear only in exhibits, but not the form; and (3) **Forms &amp; Exhibits**  if you want your search terms to search both forms and exhibits. Search Results will contain the underlying filings if you select  **Forms &amp; Exhibits**  or  **Forms Only**.
2. **FORMS**  - To search for specific SEC forms, enter form type (e.g., Form 8-K) in the search text box and utilize the available options displayed on the auto-complete list, or click **Browse Full List**  to view a full list of available forms.
3. **AMENDMENTS**  - Click on the **Include** , **Exclude** or **Only** amendments radial button to specify whether you want to include or exclude filing amendments in your search or to only search for amendments.
4. **EXHIBITS**  - To search for a specific Exhibit, enter the exhibit type in the search text box and utilize the available options displayed on the auto-complete list, or click **Browse Full List**  to make a selection.
5. **EXHIBIT TITLE -**  Search the descriptive titles of EDGAR exhibits that filers have included, if any. Although some EDGAR filers include descriptive titles for their exhibits, the SEC does not require inclusion of these titles. As a result, search results based on this search criteria may be incomplete.

### How to Use the Company/Filer Information Search Fields

1. **FILER NAMES**  - Enter an individual or entity name to search documents filed by a specific filer, issuer, company, or reporting owner.
2. **CIK**  - Every company and individual who files with the SEC is granted a unique identifier called a Central Index Key (&quot;CIK&quot;). A CIK number includes all former names of the relevant entity or individual. Generally, searching by CIK is more comprehensive than searching by the name of a filer, reporting owner, or issuer.
3. **COMPANY OR TICKER**  - The  **Company or Ticker**  field returns filings for a company listed on a stock exchange (1) that are filed by that company; (2) that are filed by an insider in which the entered company is the subject; and/or (3) that involve that company in a publicly reported merger or acquisition, but not necessarily filed by that company.
4. **COMPANY LOCATION**  - Type a few letters of the U.S. city, U.S. state, or country where at least one of the parties to the filing maintains its principal place of business and choose from the list.
5. **PLACE OF INCORPORATION**  - Type a few letters of the U.S. state or country of the filer&#39;s state or country of incorporation and choose from the options to search for documents filed by a party that is organized in that location.
6. **SIC INDUSTRY**  - You can enter an industry name or Standard Industrial Classification (&quot;SIC&quot;) code to search EDGAR filings related to a specific industry. Enter the name of the industry in this field or click  **Browse Full List**  and select it from the industry index drop-down menu.

### How to Use the Submission Information Search Fields

1. **FILING DATE**  - Click the  **Filing Date**  drop-down menu to search by date or date range of the filing.
2. **PERIOD DATE**  – Click the **Period Date** drop-down to search by the applicable period for the associated filing.
3. **EDGAR FILE No.**  - The SEC assigns unique file numbers to registrations, applications, and reports made by issuers. Use this field to find forms or exhibits by their specific EDGAR File Number.

## Precedent Documents Overview

## Draft Analyzer

**Draft Analyzer**  is Bloomberg Law&#39;s proprietary tool that uses machine learning to help lawyers compare provisions in their draft to similarly drafted paragraphs in the millions of exhibits filed in EDGAR.

### How it Works

Draft Analyzer uses an algorithm to show you the developing consensus among drafters based on its analysis of each paragraph from virtually every agreement and organizational document filed as an EDGAR exhibit. Our system first categorizes each paragraph based on textual similarity and constructs one or more unified versions (&quot;composites&quot;) for each identified cluster of similarly worded paragraphs. A composite reflects the most common language in its underlying source documents.

To use Draft Analyzer, click on the **Draft Analyzer** link in the Drafting Tools tile or type &quot;draft analyzer&quot; in the search bar. Then, copy, drag and drop, or upload text into the text box and click  **Analyze**. Draft Analyzer can also be run over documents pulled from our Precedent Search by clicking the green **Run Draft Analyzer** button in the top right-hand corner of the document.

![tic 05](/images/tic-screen-shot-05.jpg)

![tic 06](/images/tic-screen-shot-06.jpg)

### Composite Paragraphs

When you run Draft Analyzer over your text, it presents the **Most Common** and **Closest Match** clusters of linguistically similar paragraphs. The Composite Paragraphs are machine generated composites of the individual paragraphs within a given cluster. Note, in some instances, the Most Common composite, or the linguistically similar cluster with the most underlying paragraphs, and the Closest Match composite, the linguistically similar cluster most like your paragraph, will be the same. You can also filter the underlying sources to adjust the composite based on criteria of most interest to you. Available filters include: **Law Firm, Year, Agreement Type, and Industry**.

![tic 07](/images/tic-screen-shot-07.jpg)

### Underlying Sources

In addition to reviewing the composites, you can review and compare your text to each of the underlying source documents. When reviewing the individual par8graphs, click on the hyperlinked document name to view the paragraph in the context of its entire source document.

![tic 05](/images/tic-screen-shot-08.jpg)

**Compare Your Text**

Use our redlining tool to compare your text against the composite paragraphs or any of the underlying paragraphs. To view a comparison, select the **Compare Your Text** button under the paragraph against which you wish to compare. This will display a three-column page with your text on the left and the text to which you are comparing on the right. In the middle will be the comparison. Additions to your text appear in green and removals in red. Some text will be interactive, meaning there is more than one potential option based on the underlying paragraphs. This text will be highlighted in blue and, if hovered over, will present a pop-up displaying the various options. You can select the **Change Order** button in the upper right of the display to modify the order of the comparison.

![tic 09](/images/tic-screen-shot-09.jpg)

### What it means

Because Draft Analyzer is at root a data analysis tool, there are many ways to interpret results. We identify a few common interpretations and uses here.

- **Focus on Important Provisions**. Draft Analyzer can reveal just how &quot;standard&quot; some language is. Composites based upon hundreds or even thousands of underlying documents are far more standardized than those with only a handful of underlying documents. This reveals that some provisions are simply not negotiated very much while others are almost always negotiated. This does not mean that standardized language cannot be changed, but may help you understand and anticipate which provisions your client and counterparty will negotiate so you can devote extra attention to crafting them and extra preparation for negotiating them.
- **Heavily Negotiated or Custom Provisions**. Language that produces composites with few source documents, or is unable to generate a comparison at all, may be a highly-negotiated provision or a unique expression of a particular provision. This is because Draft Analyzer identifies language that is used again and again.
- **Expedited Review**. Many good drafters begin by reviewing similar documents from past transactions and then producing a draft that includes the strengths and omits the weaknesses of their precedent documents. Draft Analyzer can dramatically speed this process because each composite incorporates the wording of its underlying documents. By reviewing a composite, you effectively review all of the underlying documents.
- **&quot;Missing&quot; Language**. Some composites include additions that reveal language that was &quot;missing&quot; from the input text. Sometimes, the missing elements were intentionally removed through negotiation or where portions of an EDGAR filing are given confidential treatment by the SEC. In other situations, the missing language may have been left out unintentionally. The additions that Draft Analyzer identifies can be valuable clues to wording that you should include in your own work.
