## Draft Analyzer

**Draft Analyzer** lets you compare your draft language against EDGAR
exhibits to determine market standard language. The system matches your
text to similar templates representing consensus drafting from EDGAR.
You can browse the documents from EDGAR that make up each template using
filters for party, law firm, document title and year. This reveals
exactly which law firms and parties are using the language and how
recently, and allows you to make sure that your language is exceptional
only when you want it to be.

### How it Works

Draft Analyzer is powered by Exemplify™ – our patented software
application that uses an algorithm to show you the developing consensus
among drafters based on its analysis of each paragraph from virtually
every agreement and organizational document filed as an EDGAR exhibit.
Our system first categorizes each paragraph based on textual similarity
and constructs one or more unified versions (“consensus templates”) for
each identified cluster of similarly worded paragraphs. A consensus
template reflects the most common language in the template's source
documents. It also identifies and quantifies areas of linguistic
variance and displays the most common alternative words or phrases used
in its source paragraphs.

Copy or drag and drop text into the text box and click **Analyze**. When
using the Deal Analytics tool, some documents have the option to send a
document directly to the Draft
Analyzer.

![DraftAnalyzerdocument](/images/tlaw_Draft_Analyzer_document.jpg "DraftAnalyzerdocument")

The Results display includes a menu bar
 ![DraftAnalyzermenubar](/images/tlaw_Draft_Analyzer_menu_bar.jpg "DraftAnalyzermenubar") to access Templates and Sources, and the
standard **Print**, **Email** and **Save**
options. 

![DraftAnalyzerredline](/images/tlaw_Draft_Analyzer_redline.jpg "DraftAnalyzerredline")

### Consensus Templates

When you input your own text, our proprietary algorithm will often
identify multiple matching templates, each showing how your language
differs from the consensus it represents. Template results are ranked by
consensus size – the number of sources that contribute to the template.

### Consensus Analytics

Click the **Template**
icon ![IconTemplates](/images/tlaw_Icon_Templates.jpg "IconTemplates") to display Consensus Analytics . On the results page
below each matching consensus template is a consensus details report
that can help you determine the consensus template’s strength and
relevance to your transaction. Some consensus templates may be dominated
by multiple agreements from a single drafter – such as when a company
publicly files many agreements based on a single form, or repeats a
transaction with the same documentation. In that case, the consensus
will reveal the form of the agreement used, but does not necessarily
demonstrate that many different drafters have converged on the best
language. 

![DraftAnalyzerresultsSource](/images/tlaw_Draft_Analyzer_results_Source.jpg "DraftAnalyzerresultsSource")

### Sources and Filters

You can also click **See All Sources** from the results page to examine
each of the underlying sources that form the selected consensus template
and filter by **Law Firm**, **Year** and **Agreement Type** to see how
the template would change if it were based solely on the source
documents in your filtered subset.

### What it means

Because Draft Analyzer is at root a data analysis tool, there are many
ways to interpret results. We identify a few common interpretations and
uses here.

* **Focus on Important Provisions**. Draft Analyzer can reveal just
  how “standard” some language is. Templates that are based upon
  hundreds or even thousands of underlying documents are far more
  standardized than templates with only a handful of underlying
  documents. This reveals that some provisions are simply not
  negotiated very much while others are almost always negotiated. This
  does not mean that standardized language cannot be changed, but may
  help you understand and anticipate which provisions your client and
  counterparty will negotiate so you can devote extra attention to
  crafting them and extra preparation for negotiating them.
* **Heavily Negotiated or Custom Provisions**. Language that produces
  only a few templates with few source documents, or even no template
  at all, is most likely either a highly-negotiated provision or a
  nearly unique piece of custom drafting made for only a specific
  transaction. This is because Draft Analyzer identifies language that
  is used again and again. Highly-negotiated and custom drafting will
  almost always be unique and may not appear in Draft Analyzer.
* **Expedited Review**. Many good drafters begin by reviewing many
  similar documents from past transactions and then producing a draft
  that includes all of the strengths and omits all of the weaknesses
  of their precedent documents. Draft Analyzer can dramatically speed
  this process because each template already incorporates the wording
  of all underlying documents. By reviewing a template, you
  effectively review all of the underlying documents. By reviewing all
  of the templates that Draft Analyzer offers, you can review very
  many similar documents simultaneously to incorporate their strengths
  into your draft and remove the weaknesses that the marked templates
  reveal.
* **"Missing” Language**. Some templates will include additions that
  reveal language that was “missing” from the input text. Sometimes,
  the missing elements were intentionally removed through negotiation
  or where portions of an EDGAR filing are given confidential
  treatment by the SEC – Draft Analyzer will often give at least a
  partial clue to what was redacted. Sometimes, the missing language
  was left out unintentionally. The additions that Draft Analyzer
  identifies can be valuable clues to wording that you should include
  in your own work.

remove an item from a **Favorites** list click the **Star** icon to
deselect.   

![EdgarFormsIcons](/images/tlaw_edgar_forms_icons.jpg "EdgarFormsIcons")

 **How to Use the EDGAR Specialized Search**

1. **KEYWORDS -** Search for exact phrases by placing them in quotes,
   or connect keywords using Boolean search operators. \
   **KEYWORDS APPLY TO -** Select **Forms Only** if you want your
   search terms to appear only in the underlying forms. Select
   **Exhibits Only** if you want your search terms to appear only in
   exhibits, and select **Forms & Exhibits** if you want your search
   terms to appear in both**.** Search Results will contain the
   underlying filings if you select **Forms & Exhibits** or **Forms
   Only**. When **Exhibits Only** is selected,\*\* \*\*search results
   contain the exhibits themselves. Click the exhibit link in the
   results list and go directly to that exhibit.
2. **FORMS** - To search for specific SEC forms, enter terms in the
   search text box and utilize the available options displayed on the
   auto-complete list, or click the **Browse Full List** link and make
   a selection.
3. **INSIDER FILINGS and INSIDER AMENDMENTS** - Click the radial slide
   buttons to include or exclude **Insider Filings** and **Insider
   Amendments**.\
   ![Edgarsliderbuttons](/images/tlaw_Edgar_slider_buttons.jpg "Edgarsliderbuttons")  
4. **EXHIBITS** - To search for a specific Exhibit, enter terms in the
   search text box and utilize the available options displayed on the
   auto-complete list, or click the **Browse Full List** link and make
   a selection. To limit your search to a standard exhibit number use
   the Exhibits Full List.
5. **EXHIBIT TITLE -** Search the descriptive titles of EDGAR exhibits
   that filers have included, if any. Although some EDGAR filers
   include descriptive titles for their exhibits, the SEC does not
   require inclusion of these titles. As a result, search results based
   on this search criteria may be incomplete.

### How to Use the Company/Filer Information Search Fields

1. **FILER NAMES** - Enter an individual or entity name to search
   documents filed by a specific filer, issuer, company or reporting
   owner.
2. **CIK** - Every company and individual who files with the SEC is
   granted a unique identifier called a Central Index Key (“CIK”). A
   CIK number includes all former names of the relevant entity or
   individual. Generally, searching by CIK is more comprehensive than
   searching by the name of a filer, reporting owner or issuer.
3. **COMPANY OR TICKER** - The **Company or Ticker** field returns
   filings in which a company that is listed on a securities exchange
   and has a ticker is the filer, the subject company of insider
   filings on insider filings and/or the target of a publicly-reported
   merger or acquisition.
4. **COMPANY GROUP** - Limit your search to 100 companies that meet
   specified criteria. All criteria is determined using Bloomberg data
   after the close of each trading day in the United States. The most
   current market information is matched to the date of the latest
   EDGAR filing made by a company. Therefore, only companies that meet
   the selected criteria and have submitted an EDGAR filing since
   meeting that criteria are included in a group. 
5. **COMPANY LOCATION** - Type a few letters of the U.S. city, U.S.
   state or country where at least one of the parties to the filing
   maintains its principal place of business and choose from the list.
6. **PLACE OF INCORPORATION** - Type a few letters of the U.S. State or
   country of the filer’s state or country of incorporation and choose
   from the options to search for documents filed by a party that is
   organized in that location.
7. **SIC INDUSTRY** - You can enter an industry name or Standard
   Industrial Classification (“SIC”) code to search EDGAR filings
   related to a specific industry. Enter the name of the industry in
   this field or click **Browse Full List** and select it from the
   industry index drop-down menu.

### How to Use the Submission Information Search Fields

1. **FILING DATE** - Click the **Filing Date** drop-down menu to make a
   selection.
2. **PERIOD DATE** - To search for  a specific Period Date click in the
   field and choose any of the options in the drop-down menu. 
3. **EDGAR FILE No.** - The SEC assigns unique file numbers to
   registrations, applications and reports made by issuers. Use this
   field to find forms or exhibits by their specific EDGAR File Number.
