# Workspaces and Saved for Later Overview

Use Workspaces to organize research and collaborate with colleagues
about the research. Save _Bloomberg Law_ documents and searches and add
external files to a Workspace. Invite colleagues to review the research
and add their comments to any Workspace document. Access Workspaces from
anywhere at any time.

Use Workspaces to:

1. Create a file/folder pertaining to each case or subject matter,
2. Tag and classify information inside the Workspace,
3. View recent activity, and
4. Collaborate about the research on a Workspace.

The Workspace Owner is notified about Workspace activity (adding
documents, commenting etc.) by any of the Workspace member. When there
is activity by the Workspace Owner (invitations to join etc.), the other
members of the Workspace are notified. 

**Saved For Later**

_Bloomberg Law_ clients can use **[Saved for
Later](https://www.bna.com/using-queue/ "Saved for Later")** to easily
organize search results—including documents from multiple searches
related to a common research project. Users can quickly and effectively
print, download or email packages of results from **Saved for Later**,
as well as add them to Workspaces.
